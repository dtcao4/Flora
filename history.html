          A wonderful gift of affection, flowers are often composed together in certain variety to create beautiful bouquets, with each bouquet containing different emotions and meanings.

            FLOWERS THROUGHOUT TIME

          <p>
            In ancient Greece, flowers were offered to gods and goddesses as a sign of respect and prayer; over time, this act became a social custom. Greek mythology talks about plants and flowers in the story of Persephone, the flowery transformation of Hyakinthos, and perhaps most famously in the legend of Aphrodite and Adonis. Throughout the ages, writers, poets, artists, and others have often used the rose as a metaphor for undying <em>love, beauty,</em> and <em>passion.</em>

              Flowers have greatly impacted human interaction, culture, theology, arts, and poetry. The tradition of flower arrangements has carried on today and formed a multifaceted sensory language. The reason people send flowers is motivated by more or less the same feelings as have been present throughout ancient times or the Victorian Era.

            On the other hand, for the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, flowers were a sign of <em>opulence, beauty,</em> and, surprisingly, <em>power</em>â€”as shown in the fact that before going to war pharaohs used to decorate their chariots with flowers. Thus, the Egyptians would offer their loved ones flowers that grew near the Nile River, as a means of expressing their emotions.

            In Japan, plants and flowers have long been key elements in both religion and way of life, due to a deep respect for all nature. In Japan, the art of flower arrangements was also a male discipline of course both genders could practice it. This art would calm their minds and help them meditate. After Buddhism appeared in Japan, this beautiful art form evolved to become more and more complex. When Japanese would visit their loved ones, they would bring a house-warming gift of floral arrangements of white flowers as they suggest water to quench a fire, with fire being their constant dread. Red flowers suggest fire, so are avoided on such occasions.
